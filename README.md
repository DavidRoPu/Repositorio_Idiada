# Repositorio_Idiada

I have uploaded a first solution and 4 updates of it.
The first two commits have been some tests and the remaining 3 commits can be considered a solution.
  
  In the first commit I have read from the terminal the dimensions, the position and the commands and I have printed the results on the terminal too.
  In this commit I have treated the orientation as a string.
  
  In the second commit I have read and written in the text files.

  In the third commit I have treated the position and orientation as two integers and one character and this has allowed me to optimize the functions. 
  Also in this commit I have added some random tests created. 
  
  In the fourth commit I have used unittest to perform the different tests of the functions.
  
  In the last commit I have optimized the rotation function and I have compressed it into one (instead of a function to rotate to the right and another to 
  rotate to the left), I have contemplated that the commands and the orientation can be lowercase letters and I have introduced a folder with 4 .txt 
  with different tests to the final solution.
